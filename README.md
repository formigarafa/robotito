# Robo-TiTO
 Robo-TiTO is alternative connection to remote machine terminal.
 
## Main Objective
Sometimes you can not reach an ssh ip:port of an host by a lot of reasons:

* host is behind NAT
* firewall protection
* remote host with dynamic ip
* port redirections
* annoying administrators
  
To avoid these problems there is the Robo-TiTO.
 
## Description
This is a light-weight bot connecting through XMPP (eg.: GTalk) that allow you runnning shell command remotely.
Robo-TiTO will not open an port to be accessed, instead of that, it will connect to a jabber service.
You will send your commands in a chat session and receive terminal output back.
You will keep "talking" to your server like you always had, but this time it will respond to you.

### Requirements

* [bundler](http://rubygems.org/gems/bundler)
* Ruby 1.8.7 _(depends on gems not working with 1.9.2)_
