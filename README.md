# Robo-TiTO
 Robo-TiTO is an alternative connection to a remote machine terminal.
 
## Main Objective
Sometimes you cannot reach an ssh ip:port of an host by a lot of reasons:

* host is behind NAT
* firewall protection
* remote host with dynamic ip
* port redirections
* annoying administrators
  
Robo-TiTO allows you circumvent these problems and execute commands remotelly on your server.
 
## Description
This is a light-weight bot connecting through XMPP (eg.: GTalk) that allows you run shell command remotely.
Robo-TiTO will not open a port to be accessed, instead of that, it will connect to a jabber service.
You send your commands in a chat session and receive terminal output back.
You will be "talking" to your server like you always did, but now you will get some answers from it.

### Requirements

* [bundler](http://rubygems.org/gems/bundler)
* Ruby <= 1.8.7 _(Unfortunately, it depends on a gems that does not work with any greater version. But works fine with that ;) )_

### Installation

```
bundle install

# adjust the bot credentials and server settings using the example file provided
cp config/credentials.rb.example credentials.rb
vim config/credentials.rb

# start with
./jabbershd start

# check additional available options with
./jabbershd -h

```
